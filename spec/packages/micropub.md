Publishing endpoint. Consumes IndieAuth access tokens for authorization.

## Functional requirements

- **Create / update / delete** actions.
- Accept both `application/json` and **form-encoded** request bodies.
- **Media endpoint** backed by **R2**.
- Query support: `q=config` and `q=source`.

## Auth / security

- Authorize via an **IndieAuth access token + scope** (see
  [indieauth.md](indieauth.md)). The token's scope gates which actions are
  permitted.
- Tokens are DPoP-bound; validation reuses [`@dwk/dpop`](dpop.md).

## Bindings (declared `Env` fragment)

- **R2 bucket** for the media endpoint.
- Storage for published content / post records (D1 or R2 per the consuming
  app's model). Authoritative state in strongly-consistent stores only — not
  KV.

## Config

- `baseUrl` / domain.
- Media bucket binding name and any size thresholds.
- Mapping/policy for where created posts are stored.

## Conformance

- [micropub.rocks](https://micropub.rocks/) and publish an entry in the
  [implementation reports](https://micropub.net/implementation-reports/). See
  [conformance-and-testing.md](../conformance-and-testing.md).
